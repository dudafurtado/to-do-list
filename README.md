# to-do-list
API rest built with the PYTHON language and framework FLASK to a technical challenge
(this project was made at the linux software so the instructions are following this path)

1. Verify the existence of the lastest version of Python on your computer.

> `$ python3 --version`

2. Is a must install the package that will care all the libraries and useful tools to play with Python.

> `$ sudo apt install python3-venv`

3. Use this code inside the file of the project. This will create the code base and the name of the file will be venv.

> `$ python3 -m venv venv`

4. To active the script 

> `$ source venv/bin/activate`

5. Python as a language asks for a framework to make the job of creating an API easier. So we need to install this friend.

> `$ pip install Flask`

6. To run the file with the code where the functions use data, manipulate, check situations and return something we use:

> `$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py`
> `$ flask run`
